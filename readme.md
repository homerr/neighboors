# neighboors 

a quick and dirty, but hopefully with time less dirty application to keep track of horrible neighbours that need local authority intervention.

this application was born out of a desire to quickly and easily capture events that can then be passed to the local authority on their preferred format. 

## info

i am a coding noob, i know a bit of c# and a bit of javascript so i am using ai to *help* code this, but i am writing the code myself. i want to use typescript as it seems to be the cool ting and i want to be cool. 

this application is as much about learning as it is about sticking it to the dickheads i live adjacent to.

## more info

i am starting this as an api only project so it can take requests from things that are already pretty such as iphone shortcuts or home assistant, giving the ability for quick fire submission with one tap on a phone. 

the whole concept of this is ease of use and speed.

once i am happy this works as i want, i will make a really simple front end to show everything that is logged, with the ability to export.

remember, i am a noob.
